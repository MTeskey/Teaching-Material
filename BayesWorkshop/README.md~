# 2016 Bayes Tutorial
Lecture slides, tutorial code, and models for an informal course on Bayesian modelling w/Stan aimed towards the social sciences. The intended prerequisites are some familiarity with basic statistics and general comfort with manipulating data, though I'm not sure how good a job I've done with keeping the level consistent.

The material requires R:

...and RStan:
